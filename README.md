## Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

This project covers the following dimensionality reduction methods:

- **Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)**: Captures non-linear structures effectively.
- **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**: Focuses on interactive visualization and clustering.
- **ISOMAP**: Preserves global structures through geodesic distance embedding.
- **UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)**: Efficient and interactive visualization for high-dimensional data.
- **MDS (Multi-Dimensional Scaling)**: Retains data distance relationships.
- **Randomized PCA**: Accelerated PCA computations for large-scale data.
- **Kernel PCA**: Extends PCA for non-linear data patterns using kernel methods.
- **Incremental PCA**: Handles large datasets with low memory overhead.
- **Factor Analysis**: Identifies latent variables and explores underlying structures.
- **Autoencoders**: Neural network-based non-linear dimensionality reduction.
